# David's VSCode Starter Kit

Hello World! This extension pack is a good start for those just beginning with VSCode. Most of the tools within this pack are language agnostic, so as to not clutter up your extensions with useless ones that you might not run into. When you start a project in a given language, it'll likely recommend you the extensions you need to get support, and I wouldn't recommend going too much beyond that as multiple related extensions can conflict with each other.

## Included Extensions

| Extension              | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Notes:

- I don't include any themes (besides material icon) as most themes that I've come into contact with are not great on the eyes for long periods of time.

- I didn't include any spellcheckers as I get annoyed with them pretty quick.

- I didn't include Prettier as it conflicted usually with the built in language formatter.

---

## What Each Do:

- Comment Anchor
  - Helps generate and highlight comments such as TODO, FIXME, and NOTE. Shows as a panel on the side. Prettier in my opinion than TodoTree or Better-Comments
- Color Manager
  - Manages a color pallet and provides a gui color picker. A lot more stable than the built in color picker.
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
  - Colors matching brackets in a unique color.
- Indent rainbow
  - Colors indentations in unique colors. Really useful for python or lots of nested if's/functions
- Format Toggle
  - Toggles formatting on and off. Useful for if a formatter is not working properly on a file
- Git Graph
  - Shows git history in a gui within VSCode and allows you to click on a commit and look at what was changed within VSCode
- Gitlens
  - Shows git authors of a piece of code within the editor. Also has a dedicated panel. Useful for when needing to see who wrote a particular piece of code and when.
- GitIgnore
  - Support for gitignore files
- Intellicode
  - Adds intelligent autocomplete/suggestion to the editor. Made by Microsoft
- Material Icon Theme
  - Adds material stylee icons to the editor and file explorer. Much nicer to look at
- "Markdown All In One"
  - Provides everything you need to get up and running writing markdown files
  - I would recommend downloading the program Marktext in addition to this
- Output Colorizer
  - Adds color to the VSCode output
- Path Intellisense
  - Autocompletes filenames within directories
- Settings sync
  - Syncs your extensions and settings across computers using your github account. Indespensible for me.
- Sort lines
  - Sorts lines as it says in a variety of ways.
- Subtle Brackets
  - Underlines matching brackets and parentheses in the editor

## Other Recommendations:

Since my pack doesn't include languages since everyone has their own tech stack, I'm going to include some other recommendations at the end here (that you can sync up between your devices with settings sync). Most of these are recommended by default, but just in case they're not, you'll find them useful I imagine.

### Java

- Java Extension Pack
  
  - 'nough said. This is the recommended one and for good reason.

- Javadoc tools
  
  - Such a life saver when making Java projects for class.

### C/C++

- C/C++
  
  - Microsoft's extension. Basic necessity.

- C/C++ Project Generator
  
  - Ahh, such a time saver.

- C/C++ Colorization Upgrade
  
  - Upgrades dem colors. 

### Vue

- Vue VS Code Extension Pack
  
  - This should have everything you need (and a little you don't, such as Prettier). I used this while learning Vue.

- Vue Peek
  
  - Not necessary, but good if you need to look into the source code at all.

- TSLint Vue
  
  - Necessary if you're developing Typescript based Vue web components.

- TSLint
  
  - Since you'll probably have to edit some regular Typescript files.

- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
  
  - Snippets make everything faster.

- JavaScript Booster
  
  - Makes refactoring JS a little easier.
