# David's VSCode Starter Kit

Hello World! This extension pack is a good start for those just beginning with VSCode. Most of the tools within this pack are language agnostic, so as to not clutter up your extensions with useless ones that you might not run into. When you start a project in a given language, it'll likely recommend you the extensions you need to get support, and I wouldn't recommend going too much beyond that as multiple related extensions can conflict with each other.

## Included Extensions

### Notes:

- I don't include any themes (besides material icon) as most themes that I've come into contact with are not great on the eyes for long periods of time.

- I didn't include any spellcheckers as I get annoyed with them pretty quick.

- There are no language specific extensions in this pack. I tried to keep them all pretty general and what I found useful regardless of what I was coding with.
