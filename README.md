# David's VSCode Starter Kit

Hello World! This extension pack is a good start for those just beginning with VSCode. Most of the tools within this pack are language agnostic, so as to not clutter up your extensions with useless ones that you might not run into. When you start a project in a given language, it'll likely recommend you the extensions you need to get support, and I wouldn't recommend going too much beyond that anyways as multiple related extensions can conflict with each other.

## Included Extensions

- Comment Anchor
  - Helps generate and highlight comments such as TODO, FIXME, and NOTE. Shows as a panel on the side. Prettier in my opinion than TodoTree or Better-Comments
- Color Manager
  - Manages a color pallet and provides a gui color picker. A lot more stable than the built in color picker.
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
  - Colors matching brackets in a unique color. Great when needing to 
- Indent rainbow
  - Colors indentations in unique colors. Really useful for python or lots of nested if's/functions
- format toggle
  - Toggles formatting on and off. Useful for if a formatter is not working properly on a file
- Git Graph
  - Shows git history in a gui within VSCode and allows you to click on a commit and look at what was changed within VSCode
- Gitlens
  - Shows git authors of a piece of code within the editor. Also has a dedicated panel. Useful for when needing to see who wrote a particular piece of code and when.
- GitIgnore
  - Support for gitignore files
- GitHub Pull Requests
  - Shows github pull requests within the VSCode gui and allows for acting on them.
- Intellicode
  - Adds intelligent autocomplete/suggestion to the editor. Made by Microsoft
- Material Icon Theme
  - Adds material stylee icons to the editor and file explorer. Much nicer to look at
- "Markdown All In One"
  - Provides everything you need to get up and running writing markdown files
  - I would recommend downloading the program Marktext in addition to this
- Output Colorizer
  - Adds color to the VSCode output
- Path Intellisense
  - Autocompletes filenames within directories
- Settings sync
  - Syncs your extensions and settings across computers using your github account. Indespensible for me.
- Sort lines
  - Sorts lines as it says in a variety of ways.
- Subtle Brackets
  - Underlines matching brackets and parentheses in the editor

### Some notes:

- I don't include any themes (besides material icon) as most that I've come into contact with are not great on the eyes for long periods of time.

- I didn't include any spellcheckers as I get annoyed with them pretty quick.

- I didn't include prettier as it conflicted usually with the built in language formatter.

## Other Recommended Packs

Now although I didn't include much in the way of language specific tools, I'm not going to leave you hanging. I've created these other extension packs that are compatible with this one to install recommended extensions for your development stack.

- Java

- Web Development

- Vue

- C++
