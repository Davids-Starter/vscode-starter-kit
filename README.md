# David's VSCode Starter Kit

Hello World! This extension pack is a good start for those just beginning with VSCode. Most of the tools within this pack are language agnostic, so as to not clutter up your extensions with useless ones that you might not run into. When you start a project in a given language, it'll likely recommend you the extensions you need to get support, and I wouldn't recommend going too much beyond that anyways as multiple related extensions can conflict with each other.
